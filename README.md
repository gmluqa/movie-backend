# movie-backend

Welcome to my first project focused on the back-end. It consists of a REST API and a Database.

For this project, I had to re-create a database similar to one a company like "BlockBusters" 📼 (rest in peace...) would use, and also a system that would handle user registration, login, authentication and authorization! [JWT](https://jwt.io/) was essential for this.

And on top of that, many endpoints that handle get requests, patch requests, delete requests, etc...

# Technologies used

The database is [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and the ORM chosen to work with MySQL is [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/). ⚙️

I relied heavily on [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) for handling everything related with the API. 🤖

# Instructions

I have uploaded the DB to a [railway](https://railway.app/) instance, this instance will only linger around for 200 hours since this REPO's creation. If you are interested in setting up the DB locally, contact me and I will personally document the local set up process, although this will be easy if you are familiar with sequelize. 😇

# Endpoints avaliable

Every single possible endpoint can be found in the `./tests` folder. 🧪
